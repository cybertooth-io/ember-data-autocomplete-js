When we started using Ember back in 2014 Twitter's Typeahead component was quite popular
and we incorporated it into our application.  Since it's been abandoned Algolia has forked
the project at [autocomplete.js](https://github.com/algolia/autocomplete.js).

This Ember addon wraps the typeahead/autocomplete functionality in a relatively convenient
component and uses Ember Data to search your models.
